# Project phase 1 - Definition and planning

I am planning to work on this project, Task Manager Web App. This app will allow users to create, update, and delete tasks while categorizing them by priority or status. I will also make basic authentication and a simple, clean UI.


## 1. User Personas

Student (Omolola, 20 years old)
Needs a way to organize assignments and deadlines.
Prefers a simple interface with minimal distractions.
Freelancer (Ibukun, 30 years old)
Manages multiple projects and wants a structured task list.
Needs task prioritization and status updates.
Small Business Owner (Wasilat, 30 years old)
Tracks business-related tasks and deadlines.
Prefers mobile accessibility.

## 2. Use Cases and User Flows

Use Case 1: Task Creation
The user logs in.
Clicks “Add Task” and enters a title, description, and deadline.
Assigns a priority level (Low, Medium, High).
Saves the task.
Use Case 2: Task Management
Users can mark tasks as complete or update details.
Users can delete tasks they no longer need.
Use Case 3: User Authentication
Users sign up and log in using a simple authentication system.
Logged-in users can view their task list.

## 3. UI Prototypes

I will design a wireframe showing:

A simple homepage with a login/register option.
A dashboard displaying tasks in a list format with buttons for “Edit” and “Delete.”
A task creation form with fields for task title, description, and deadline.

## 4. Information Architecture and Technical Design

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (React)
Backend: Node.js with Express
Database: MongoDB (or Firebase for simplicity)
Authentication: Firebase Auth
Hosting: Netlify for frontend, Render/Heroku for backend

## 5. Project Management and User Testing

Development Timeline:
Week 1: Set up project structure and UI design.
Week 2: Implement authentication and database setup.
Week 3: Task management features (CRUD).
Week 4: Final testing and deployment.
User Testing:
Get feedback from students and freelancers.
Identify usability issues and improve UI.
